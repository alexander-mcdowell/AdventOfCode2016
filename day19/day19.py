"""
# This happens to be the Josephus Problem, where the solution was described in this Numberphile video.
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCsD3ZGzMgE

# If we look at the first couple cases where n = total number of elves and f(n) returns the winner at the end:
# n  | f(n)
# ---------
# 1  | 1
# 2  | 1
# 3  | 3
# 4  | 1
# 5  | 3
# 6  | 5
# 7  | 7
# 8  | 1
# 9  | 3
# 10 | 5
# 11 | 7
# 12 | 9
# 13 | 11
# 14 | 13
# 15 | 15
# 16 | 1

# For powers of two, 1 is always the winner. After a power of two, we list the odd numbers until we reach a
# power of 2.

# f(n) = the (1 + n - largest power of two less than n)th odd number.

import math

num = int(open("day19in.txt").read().split("\n")[0])
largest_power = 2 ** int(math.log(num, 2))
winner = 2 * (1 + num - largest_power) - 1
print(winner)

# It looks like the procedure is to find the power of three just less than the number, then list
# out the numbers starting at (number - power of three) until you reach that power of three.
# Then you list out n odd numbers after that power of three until you reach the next power of three
# where n is the power of three less than the number.
